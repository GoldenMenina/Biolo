                    <p>
                      Giannu Meats is a registered brand of
                      the company
                      ZHA Servi√ßos e Investimentos LDA, an Angolan company that, among other
                      activities, is dedicated to the commercialization of
                      exclusively national meats of noble origin.
                    </p>
                    <p>We pride ourselves on serving over 2,250 customers, guaranteeing fresh and healthy meats of superior quality.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      We commercialize Beef, Pork, Goat (Kid and Lamb), and Poultry whose
                      processes of breeding, slaughtering, cutting, commercialization, and delivery to the customer,
                      meet all Bio-Security and HSA requirements, as well as certification
                      from the National Control Laboratory of our batches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As a result of the above, the meat delivered to our customers is of impeccable quality,
                      since the animals are only subject to free pasture and not
                      confinement, which prevents the spread of diseases, while
                      100% natural feeding promotes great health benefits,
                      namely high levels of omega 3, low cholesterol levels, therefore our
                      meat is considered organic, with great health benefits.
